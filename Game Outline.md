Distracted Driving App

The DD App is a game for Android that covers and brings to light the dangers of driving distracted. The game uses very basic one touch controls for a pick-up and play style. The game is a survival game where the player controls a car and avoids obsticals on the road, in this game pylons, with the intent to add more variety of obsticals in a future updates. 

Whlie driving the player will use the up and down arrows found on the bottom of the screen. However every so often the driver will become "distracted" where the controls will be removed and the player will be made to answer a question on distracted driving. If the player does not answer fast enough they will crash, demonstrating that it is very difficult to do two things at once while driving. When the quiz appears it will be one of two types of question, either a multiple choice or true and false style. If the player answers incorrectly a new question will appear. 

The game has no social features as it is meant to be a tool to show how dangerous distracted driving is, and including a competitive or social aspect would take away from the seriousness of the issue. The game is short and sweet with plans to implement more features in the future such as increasing speeds of obsticals and randomization of obstical location.
